Plan:
    -Create npm project
        (npm init -y): this has given us a package.json files
        this file contains all the meta data

    -create index, css, js files
        (style.css and client.js is inside the public folder)
        index.html inside the root folder

    -install dependencies, express, nodemon(dev, dep.)
        (npm install express)- to handle all server side code and routing
        (npm install nodemon -D)- whenever we will edit our server file, then manually we do not have to restart the server everytime.

    -create an express server(server.js)
        (inside root folder)

    -do frontend part

    -Install and set up socket.ioin server.js and client.js
        (ctrl+ c to stop listening the server)
        (npm install socket.io)
        (npm run dev - to start listening to the server)
        
    -client and message logic in client.js
    -receive message on server and broadcast to all clients
    -receive message on client and display it
